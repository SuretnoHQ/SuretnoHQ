# Hello, I'm Muhibbudin Suretno ðŸ‘‹

A passionate developer with a knack for turning ideas into functional, beautiful code. Over the past nine years on GitHub, Iâ€™ve built a vibrant collection of several public repositories that showcase my experience in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and TypeScript. My activity comes in waves, with periodic bursts of creativity and contribution that highlight my commitment to meaningful projects.

I enjoy exploring a mix of front-end and back-end technologies, though JavaScript and CSS are my go-to tools of the trade. Along the way, Iâ€™ve dabbled in TypeScript, PHP, Go, and even Shell scriptingâ€”versatility is my habits!

Itâ€™s been an incredible journey so far, and Iâ€™m excited to keep building, learning, and sharing with the developer community. 

Letâ€™s create something amazing together!
